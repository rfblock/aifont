# Font designed by an AI
This is a font that was designed entire by ChatGPT \
The prompts used to design these is `Write SVG code for the glyph "X"`, repeated for each capital letter \
The resulting SVG files were then converted to use only fills via [SVGFixer](https://github.com/oslllo/svg-fixer) \
Finally, all the SVG files were uploaded to [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/) to convert into `.ttf` and `.woff` formats
